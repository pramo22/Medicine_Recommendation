Ortho Cyclen,7.867325528912771,birth control,"""this is the first birth control pill i've ever been on and have no major complaints.  i'm a healthy height/weight and exercise regularly.  i just finished my third pack.  during the first month, i had breakthrough bleeding (as expected with most pills) off and on, but that was it.  my breasts are a little more tender, but it's nothing bothersome.  the pill definitely hasn't bothered my sex drive either.  i'm glad i stuck out the first month, because this pill has been great for me so far!""",Positive,12031
