12032,Bonine,motion sickness,"""i wanted to take a helicopter ride while on a trip to kauai. i have a horrible history of motion sickness. someone suggested bonine so i tried that. i not only made it through the entire 90 minute ride, but i actually enjoyed it and didn't once have the horrible motion sick feeling. """,10.0,0.56219995,Positive
12032,Transderm-Scop,motion sickness,"""the reason i'm giving it a 9 instead of 10 is because of it's side effects. otherwise, this patch works really well for an overnight or two day fishing trip (at least in my experience). i thought i'm getting cold and feeling sick after i get off the fishing boat because my throat was getting dry and dryer and dryer. at that time i'm not aware that one of it's side effects was dry mouth/throat. aside from that, i didn't feel anything anymore after couple of days. i'll use it again for my next fishing trip. i'll opt for a dry throat verses getting sick on the boat.""",9.0,0.5279974,Positive
12032,Phenergan,motion sickness,"""i has on a plane for 26 hours with 5 stops and not much down time on the ground.  for the first time i was able to eat and sleep for longer then 10 minutes.  not the best medicine for someone that needs to be alert and fully functioning.  once on the ground for good i needed to be alert and doing my job.  it took around 20 min and some water.""",9.0,0.5247688,Positive
12032,Marezine,motion sickness,"""it was ten minutes before my 30 minute puddle jumper flight. a friend knew of my sickness and handed me box of marzine and said take one so i did. what difference, no side effects no sickness. was not sleepy or tired. felt great after flight.""",10.0,0.519135,Positive
12032,Bonine,motion sickness,"""both my son and i took this on a diving trip and it worked great.  no side effects.  i have high blood pressure and had no effects that i could tell.  we took 1 the night before and 1 an hour before the boat left the dock.""",10.0,0.50773716,Positive

12031,Skyla,birth control,"""the only reason why i wouldn't give this birth control a 10 is because it started to give me recurring and unbearable bv that i could not stand to deal with. everything else was perfect! might have had my period a few extra days but my flow was lighter-normal, no acne, no mood swing, no bloat. i did get slightly stronger cramps but that was fine.""",8.0,0.7243779,Positive
12031,Nexplanon,birth control,"""i've had it since january of this year. i love it. i've only spotted once. the only thing i don't like is that i gained 10lbs. other than that, it's convenient for my busy life.""",9.0,0.69926655,Positive
12031,ParaGard,birth control,"""i have had an overall great experience with this iud. i actually had one placed ten years ago and just recently had it replaced. this has been a very effective birth control. i can't have added hormones so it was either this or condoms ten years ago and i'm glad i chose this.""",10.0,0.69725406,Positive
12031,Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,birth control,"""i've been on this pill for around 7 weeks and so far so good. i have a bit of bloating/gas pain and breast tenderness but other than that i am thrilled. the cost is a bit high as there aren't any generic versions of this exact pull out there but, to me, it's been worth the cost.""",9.0,0.68997866,Positive
12031,Mirena,birth control,"""this is my second time around on mirena. first time, i loved it. had it taken out after 5 years and only took me weeks to get pregnant. the second time around, i am about 7 weeks into it and i am still bleeding. heavy and light bleeding. other than that, so far so good.""",9.0,0.6897223,Positive
12031,Epiduo,acne,0.70933205,"""honestly at first i couldnt even tell anything was happening, i went in and out of stages and it almost seemed my acne got worse. that was just the epiduo pulling the dirt and junk and acne out. now 4 months in, my acne is completely gone. i had horrible acne as well. this has changed my life.""",Positive
12031,Epiduo,acne,0.68824923,"""amazing! had bad spots for years finally went to the docs and got this. within a week most of my spots have gone and my skin looks the best it has in years! recommend this to everyone!""",Positive
12031,Benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin,acne,0.6861185,"""this was kind of a miracle cream for me, after my course of treatment (12 weeks) was up, i had a completely clear face. now, about 5 months later, my spots are starting to return so i think if i had kept using the cream for longer it would have banished them for good.""",Positive
12031,Claravis,acne,0.6800367,"""my acne was horrible and literally hurt. i had huge zits all over my chin, back and face. going on claravis wasn't easy, but i've been off it for 2 months and haven't had one zit yet. it changed my life and boosted my self confidence extraordinarily. i get compliments on my skin all the time and i am so so so so so thankful for claravis - it was my miracle and i know without it my skin would have never ever been this beautiful.""",Positive
12031,Duac,acne,0.67317253,"""my acne was really bad i took some tablets and then that cleared my skin from acne but not the spots so i went to my docter and she gave me this. i'm still using it butii can see a lot of improvment thank you duac""",Positive
12031,Skyla,birth control,0.71756524,"""the only reason why i wouldn't give this birth control a 10 is because it started to give me recurring and unbearable bv that i could not stand to deal with. everything else was perfect! might have had my period a few extra days but my flow was lighter-normal, no acne, no mood swing, no bloat. i did get slightly stronger cramps but that was fine.""",Positive
12031,Cryselle,birth control,0.7076416,"""i can't rate this a 10, because nothing works perfectly. but this is the best birth control that i have been on this far. i am 26 years old and i have been on 2 birth control pills previously that had not worked out nearly as well as cryselle. i developed as i was taking the other birth control pills, many ovarian cysts which led to spotting and constant pain. i also rarely got my period, even while taking the placebo pills. my doctor switched me to this and i regularly get a period now and have little to no pain. for me, this is the best thing that has happened to me.""",Positive
12031,Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,birth control,0.67098767,"""i am 23 and i have been on birth control for 7 years. i switched from ortho tri-cyclen to sprintec 3 years ago and it works amazingly. i have controlled periods and my mood stabilizes greatly with this birth-control.""",Positive
12031,Medroxyprogesterone,birth control,0.6701316,"""i just got this shot 1 week ago and i don't even notice a difference. i can't tell i even got it. i have actually been in a better mood since  receiving it. not everyone i know has had the same experience. so all i can say is it's worth a shot. no pun intended :)""",Positive
12031,Dienogest / estradiol,birth control,0.66751134,"""this pill didn't give me any of the listed side effects, and my periods were only about 2-3 days (which is very short for me, loved that). if that was all, i would give it a 10, however, it completely killed my ability to get aroused (wet), my libido was there and i was very into the intimate moments, but i was very dry ....unlike me.  it also made my skin and scalp very dry too, it's like it sucked all the moisture out of my body.  i switched to a different pill and the dryness problems went away in about a week.  definitely not the right birth control pill for me.""",Positive
